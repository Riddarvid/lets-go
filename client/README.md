This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## TODO

- Fix final game logic (the same game state not allowed twice. How to store efficiently?)
- Display the number of captured stones. Store this in the DB.
- Remove secrets from code. How to do this?
